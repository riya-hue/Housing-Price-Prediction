# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction & Clustering Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts house prices using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, and explores housing patterns using 3 unsupervised models: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and PCA.

⚠️ Note: Supervised models predict prices, while unsupervised models reveal hidden patterns and clusters.
